## A Simple React App for Browsing Hot Sauces

This project was created as a way to learn the basics of React. Because it pulls in images dynamically from Wikipedia, the dimensions and proportions of the images can vary widely. To account for this, I designed a masonry grid system using the CSS property `column-count`, which allows for maximum flexibility while maintaining a clear and pleasing aesthetic. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run locally: 
npm install
npm start
